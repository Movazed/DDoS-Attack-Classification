## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ddos-attack-classification.git
    cd ddos-attack-classification
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Dataset

Place your raw dataset files in the `data/raw/` directory. Detailed instructions for preparing the data can be found in the `data/README.md` file.

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

    Open and run the `notebooks/eda.ipynb` notebook to explore the dataset and visualize various features.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**

    Open and run the `notebooks/model.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

### Source Code


- `src/model.ipynb`: Scripts for defining and training the machine learning model.
